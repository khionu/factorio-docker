# WIP - Factorio Docker Container
This container is everything you need to get a headless, experimental-build Factorio server running.

Includes:
- [Init script](https://github.com/Bisa/factorio-init)
- [Update Script](https://github.com/narc0tiq/factorio-updater)
- SSH on by default (**READ WARNING**)

### WARNING
The default setup turns on SSH and includes an **INSECURE** public key, which you can find in the `keys` folder of this repository. **REPLACE IT IMMEDIATELY.**

If you know how to use Docker, you should be able to Google how to do so.
